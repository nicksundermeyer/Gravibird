# Gravibird

This was a project made for a game design class in collaboration with another student. Our primary design philosophy with this piece was to try to create a single-button experience, which is a challenging design problem as it doesn't give you much leeway in terms of game mechanics. At first, we were going to make a simple jump over obstacles, but had the idea to instead incorporate the gravity-switching mechanic, with some blocks that fell with the player to provide an ever-changing landscape to navigate. I found this mechanic particularly compelling as it gives the player the ability to change the course on the fly with well-timed presses, and the obstacles become almost like a secondary character that the player is able to control.

Our greatest challenge with this project was probably sticking with our original design idea and keeping it to only one button press. We had many different ideas for mechanics to incorporate, all of which would have required extra button presses, but we wanted to keep it simple and avoid adding too many unnecessary things to the game. In the end, I think this turned out well, and I was glad that we were able to get through to a complete product by the end.
